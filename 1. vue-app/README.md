# Vue app
Make sure you have Node (>=4.x).

## Getting started
```bash
npm i -g vue-cli
```

Choose one of the two options: `webpack` or `browserify`. They also have some simple versions.

We'll go for `webpack`, see the [Boiler](https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack) and [Boiler docs](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/index.html).

```bash
# NB: might require a new terminal session
vue init webpack frameworks-app
```
In the dark 🌃🌙🌚? See [the cli-docs](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli).


```bash
cd frameworks-app
npm i

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev
```

## Other Commands

``` bash
# build for production with minification
npm run build

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run e2e tests
npm run e2e

# run all tests
npm test
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).


## DIY 🔨🛠🔧☭
- **Feature 1: delete todo**. *Add a delete button to remove todos one by one no matter if they are done or not.*
- **Feature 2: state persistance**. *Store the todos via localStorage & load up the previous items upon refresh*.
- 💤 **Feature 3: link todos**. *add [vue-router](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router) and link each item in the todo list. The single todo page should be fairly simple, but you should still be able to check / uncheck a todo item there.*

**NB: this will count as 50% of your exam score! 😱**
